        <h3>What is a Vector Field</h3>
        <p>
            Scalars describe the magnitude of a phenomena, while vectors describe both magnitude and direction.
            Vector fields are functions that assign a vector to every point \((x,y,z)\) in space.
            A bold face symbol will indicates a vector or vector field.
            Electromagnetic problems are separated into two temporal categories, arbitrary time and harmonic time.
            Real life usually adheres to arbitrary time dependence.
            For example if a switch in a circuit is closed at time \(t\), the time dependence of the voltage would be a step function.
            Arbitrary time dependant quantities will be represented with script symbols \(\t{A}\).
            Combining time and vector notations, an arbitrary time dependant vector field is written like 
            \begin{equation*}
                \tv{A}=\tv{A}(x,y,z;t)
            \end{equation*}
            It is important to keep in mind that vectors are abstractly defined as the combination of magnitude and direction. 
            However, they are commonly described in terms of a coordinate system.
            In Cartesian coordinates, a general vector \(\v{v}\) is projected onto the Cartesian unit vectors \(\v{v}=v_x\uv{x}+v_y\uv{y}+v_z\uv{z}\).
            Where \(v_x,v_y,v_z\) are the vector components.
            Vector fields can also be written in component form
            \begin{equation*}
                \tv{A}=\t{A}_x(x,y,z;t)\uv{x}+\t{A}_y(x,y,z;t)\uv{y}+\t{A}_z(x,y,z;t)\uv{z}
            \end{equation*}
            Where \(A_x,A_y\) and \(A_z\) are component functions of space and time instead of numbers like in the single vector case.
            A vector with a hat indicates it is a unit vector \(\uv{v}\).
            For example the unit vectors of the Cartesian coordinate system are written as
            \begin{equation*}
                \uv{x}=\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}\quad
                \uv{y}=\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\\0\end{bmatrix}\quad
                \uv{z}=\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\1\end{bmatrix}\quad
            \end{equation*}
            Harmonic time dependence is a mathematical nicety.
            When it exists in real life, it is usually human created because its so nice mathematically.
            Harmonic time is a fancy way to say the time varies like cosine or sine.
            Differential equations with time derivatives can be entirely replaced with algebraic phasors.
            Certain electromagnetic measurement equipment operates with one frequency at a time (VNA, SNA).
            The fourier transform can combining several frequencies together to construct arbitrary periotic time dependence.
            This sort of analysis has build in assumptions like linearity of superposition. 
            Luckily this is usually how electromagnetic quantities work.

        <h3>Quantities and Units</h3>
        <p>
            There are several ways to introduce electromagnetic quantities.
            Introductory electromagnetic books often start with coulombs law, relating it to the electric field.
            Then introduce how the electric field intensity interacts with materials, effectively introducing electric flux density.
            The full Lorentz force is then introduced along side the magnetic flux density and so on.
            This gives an nice picture of each quantity, and attempts to give some intuition about the sources of each quantity.
            The main draw back of this introductory picture is it often developes bad advanced electromagnetic intuition.
            Changing electric or magnetic fields induce each other in interesting ways.
            Often these bad habits have to be unlearned when learning advance electromagnetic.
            The advanced picture of electromagnetic often leverages units as a hand hold for intuition.
            Then the differential Maxwell's equations are introduced in arbitrary and time harmonic forms.

        <h3>Time dependent Maxwell's Equations in Differential Form</h3>
        <p>
            Maxwells equations takes the quantities the previous section and relates them via a set of first order, coupled partial differential equations.
            \begin{align}
                \nabla \times \tv{E} &= -\tv{M}_i - \frac{\partial \tv{B}}{\partial t} \\
                \nabla \times \tv{H} &= \tv{J}_i + \tv{J}_c + \frac{\partial \tv{D}}{\partial t} \\
                \nabla \cdot \tv{D} &= \t{q}_{\text{ev}} \\
                \nabla \cdot \tv{B} &= \t{q}_{\text{mv}}
            \end{align}
        </p>
        <h3>Time harmonic Maxwell's Equations in Differential Form</h3>
        <p>
            Instead of assuming each vector field depends on time, a purely spacial vector field \(\v{E}(x,y,z)\) is combined with an sinusoidal time dependence to form an arbitrary time dependant quantity.
            \begin{equation*}
            \tv{E}(x,y,z;t)=\text{Re}\left[\v{E}(x,y,z)e^{j\omega t}\right]
            \end{equation*}
            This assumption (the time harmonic assumption) turns time derivatives into a multiplication by \(j \omega\).
            This simplification leads to the time harmonic Maxwell's equations
            \begin{align}
                \nabla \times \v{E} &= -\v{M}_i - j \omega \v{B} & \text{Faraday's Law} \\
                \nabla \times \v{H} &= \v{J}_i + \v{J}_c + j \omega \v{D} & \text{Ampere's Law} \\
                \nabla \cdot \v{D} &= q_{\text{ev}} & \text{Gauss's Law} \\
                \nabla \cdot \v{B} &= q_{\text{mv}}
            \end{align}
        </p>
        <h3>Charge Conservation</h3>
        <p>
            Charge is conserved, while this can be derived from Maxwells equations it is important enough to state explicitly.
            Taking the divergence of Ampere's law result in
            \begin{equation*}
                \nabla \cdot \left(\nabla \times \v{H}\right) 
                = \nabla \cdot \v{J}_i + \nabla \cdot \v{J}_c + j \omega \left(\nabla \cdot \v{D}\right)\\
            \end{equation*}
            The divergence of the curl of a vector field is zero.
            This is a good vector identity to prove to yourself.
            \begin{equation*}
                \nabla \cdot \v{J}_i + \nabla \cdot \v{J}_c = - j \omega \left(\nabla \cdot \v{D}\right)\\
            \end{equation*}
            Using Gauss's law the right hand side of the above equation transforms into the time derivative of charge density.
            \begin{equation*}
                \nabla \cdot \tv{J}_{ic} = - \frac{\partial \t{q}_{ev}}{\partial t}
            \end{equation*}
        </p>
        <h3>Wave Equation</h3>
        <p>
            Maxwell's equations have to benefit of being coupled partial differential equations.
            In certain situations they are a simple way to find either the electric and magnetic field.
            However combining Maxwell's equations into a few uncoupled differential equation is useful as well.
