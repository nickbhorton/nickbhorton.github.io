        <h3>What is a Vector Field</h3>
        <p>
            Scalars describe the magnitude of a phenomena, while vectors describe both magnitude and direction.
            Vector fields are functions that assign a vector to every point \((x,y,z)\) in space.
            A bold face symbol will indicates a vector or vector field.
            Electromagnetic problems are separated into two temporal categories, arbitrary time and harmonic time.
            Real life usually adheres to arbitrary time dependence.
            For example if a switch in a circuit is closed at time \(t\), the time dependence of the voltage would be a step function.
            Arbitrary time dependant quantities will be represented with script symbols \(\t{A}\).
            Combining time and vector notations, an arbitrary time dependant vector field is written like 
            \begin{equation*}
                \tv{A}=\tv{A}(x,y,z;t)
            \end{equation*}
            It is important to keep in mind that vectors are abstractly defined as the combination of magnitude and direction. 
            However, they are commonly described in terms of a coordinate system.
            In Cartesian coordinates, a general vector \(\v{v}\) is projected onto the Cartesian unit vectors \(\v{v}=v_x\uv{x}+v_y\uv{y}+v_z\uv{z}\).
            Where \(v_x,v_y,v_z\) are the vector components.
            Vector fields can also be written in component form
            \begin{equation*}
                \tv{A}=\t{A}_x(x,y,z;t)\uv{x}+\t{A}_y(x,y,z;t)\uv{y}+\t{A}_z(x,y,z;t)\uv{z}
            \end{equation*}
            Where \(A_x,A_y\) and \(A_z\) are component functions of space and time instead of numbers like in the single vector case.
            A vector with a hat indicates it is a unit vector \(\uv{v}\).
            For example the unit vectors of the cartesian coordinate system are written as
            $$
                \uv{x}=\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}\quad
                \uv{y}=\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\\0\end{bmatrix}\quad
                \uv{z}=\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\1\end{bmatrix}\quad
            $$

        <h3>Time dependent Maxwell's Equations</h3>
        <p>
            Maxwells equations takes the quantities from above and relates them via a set of first order, coupled partial differential equations.
            \begin{align}
                \nabla \times \tv{E} &= -\tv{M}_i - \frac{\partial \tv{B}}{\partial t} \\
                \nabla \times \tv{H} &= \tv{J}_i + \tv{J}_c + \frac{\partial \tv{D}}{\partial t} \\
                \nabla \cdot \tv{D} &= \t{q}_{\text{ev}} \\
                \nabla \cdot \tv{B} &= \t{q}_{\text{mv}}
            \end{align}
        </p>
        <h3>Time harmonic Maxwell's Equations</h3>
        <p>
            The general time dependent Maxwell's equations are often needlessly complex. 
            General periodic time dependence can be constructed with the Fourier transform.
            So instead electromagnetic quantities are expressed in a purely spacial dependent form.
            Where 
            \begin{equation}
            \tv{E}=\text{Re}\left[\v{E}(x,y,z)e^{j\omega t}\right]
            \end{equation}
            This simplification leads to the time harmonic Maxwell's equations
            \begin{align}
                \nabla \times \v{E} &= -\v{M}_i - j \omega \v{B} \\
                \nabla \times \v{H} &= \v{J}_i + \v{J}_c + j \omega \v{D} \\
                \nabla \cdot \v{D} &= q_{\text{ev}} \\
                \nabla \cdot \v{B} &= q_{\text{mv}}
            \end{align}
